<h1>Allo</h1>
<br>
<h3>This is your life.</h3>
<p>This is Allo, the social network open to any Person, as long as you're a student at The Iron Yard Academy Durham during Fall 2014. And maybe Clinton.</p>
<p>Allo isn't like other social networks.  In fact, it's a student project, so you don't have to worry about your information being sold to advertisers.  Ever. Probably.</p>
